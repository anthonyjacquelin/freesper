## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Create window-management spec delta with screen detection requirements
- [ ] 1.2 Modify `showRecordingWindow()` in `src/main.js` to use active screen detection
- [ ] 1.3 Add helper function to detect active screen based on cursor position
- [ ] 1.4 Add fallback logic for screen detection failures
- [ ] 1.5 Test on multi-screen setup (if available)

## 2. Testing

- [ ] 2.1 Test on single screen setup (backward compatibility)
- [ ] 2.2 Test on multi-screen setup (cursor on different screens)
- [ ] 2.3 Test edge cases (cursor at screen boundaries)
- [ ] 2.4 Verify window stays centered on correct screen
