# Placeholder - Icon Needed

To create the menu bar icon:

1. Create a 32x32 PNG image with a microphone or speech bubble
2. Make it black on transparent background
3. Name it: iconTemplate.png
4. Place it in this directory

For now, the app will run without it (may show blank in menu bar)

Quick way to create one:
- Use any icon editor or online tool
- Export as PNG at 32x32 or 16x16
- Ensure it's monochrome (black with alpha)

The app is fully functional without the icon!
